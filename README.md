**How To Demo The Game**

> In Food Fight's current state, the game will only run if four unique users are queued up for a game. 

1. Before creating any accounts please first 'Flip The Table'. This will reset the number of active players so that the next 4 players to joing should be you & three other accounts.

2. Create a new account. If demoing alone, then create three more spoof accounts in separate tabs.

3. Once the fourth account connects the player select screen will appear.

4. Enjoy!
